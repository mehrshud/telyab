Accepted

## Context
The project 'telyab' requires a decision on the programming language to be used for its development. After evaluating various options, JavaScript has emerged as a strong contender due to its versatility, wide adoption, and extensive libraries. The project's requirements include creating a dynamic and interactive user interface, handling real-time data, and integrating with other services.

## Decision
Use JavaScript as the primary programming language for the 'telyab' project. This decision is based on the following factors:
* JavaScript's ability to handle client-side scripting and create dynamic user interfaces
* Its extensive use in web development and the availability of numerous libraries and frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js)
* The ease of integration with other services and technologies, such as Node.js for server-side development

## Consequences
The consequences of using JavaScript as the primary programming language for the 'telyab' project are:
* Faster development and prototyping due to the extensive resources and libraries available
* Improved user experience through dynamic and interactive interfaces
* Easier integration with other services and technologies, reducing development time and costs
* Potential challenges in terms of code organization and maintenance, which can be mitigated through the use of modular design patterns and best practices.
